# Release Notes  
Version 1.0.0  
Date: 28 November 2025

This release includes the initial front-end structure of the Sriyog Consulting website. The project is still in development, but the main layout, routing, and several base components are already in place.

## Overview
The current build provides a working homepage, partial sections for About, Feedback, Team and Contact, and several placeholder pages. Core UI elements such as navigation, footer, newsletter section, cookie prompt, and the initial roadblock screen are functional. Most pages use temporary content and images, and several routes are still under construction.
